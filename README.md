# BASIC-Interpreter-python
GUI based simple basic interpreter in python with Tkinter library



This is my self-learning project I'm currently working at. Being inspired by very rare zx spectrum which was my very first computer I'm trying to make something look like that)). It's not an emulator, but the future features would be imitating zx spectrum behaviour as much as possible. This is also my very first python project as well so another reason to do it is to learn python itself.

I dream to work in a team making good software for people, but for now my skills are probably too low for that, so here is another reason of making this project - to upgrade my programming skills especially in OOP.

Please feel free to participate in this project if you are fond of rare computers like me. Welcome for those who much more experienced then I am - it would be great owner to learn from you how to code better. Welcome if you are a another noob just like me - we can learn together by practice.
